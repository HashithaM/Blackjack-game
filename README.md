# Blackjack-game
This is a blackjack testing game using terminal
let's break down the code step by step:

Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing the random module, which is used to generate random numbers needed for dealing cards.

Defining the deal_card() Function: This function returns a random card from a standard deck of cards. It selects a card value from the list of possible card values (including face cards with values of 10 and an ace with a value of 11) using random.choice().

Defining the compare() Function: This function takes two arguments, user_score and computer_score, and compares them to determine the outcome of the game. It checks for various conditions such as whether the scores are equal, if either player has a blackjack (a score of 21 with only two cards), if either player has gone over 21 (busted), or if one player has a higher score than the other. It returns a string indicating the result of the game.

Defining the calculate_score() Function: This function takes a list of cards as input and calculates the total score. It accounts for the special case of having an ace in the hand, where its value can be 11 or 1 depending on whether it would cause the player to bust.

Defining the play_game() Function: This function encapsulates the main logic of the game. It initializes two empty lists to hold the cards for the player and the computer (dealer). It deals two cards to each player. Then, it enters a loop where the player can choose to hit (get another card) or stand (end their turn). After the player's turn, it simulates the dealer's turn according to the rules (hit until the score is 17 or higher). Finally, it compares the scores and declares the winner.

Main Game Loop: The code prompts the user to play the game by entering 'y' or 'n'. If the user chooses to play ('y'), it calls the play_game() function. After each game, it asks the user if they want to play again.

"CLEAR" Message: This message is printed after each game iteration to clear the screen or provide a clear separation between different games.

Overall, the code implements a simplified version of the Blackjack card game where the user plays against the computer (dealer). The user can decide whether to take additional cards to improve their hand or stand with their current hand. The dealer follows a fixed strategy for playing its hand. After each game, the user is given the option to play again.
